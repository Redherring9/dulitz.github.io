**Adobe Creek Networks has incorporated.** Effective yesterday, we filed
Articles of Incorporation with the California Secretary of State and
received an IRS EIN, so we are officially a (non-profit) California
mutual benefit corporation. <i>[more...]</i>

**Pre-Permit meeting with City of Palo Alto Public Works.** On the
afternoon of the 18th, we and our contractor Next Level Networks will
meet with the Street Work workgroup at Public Works and a
representative from City of Palo Alto Utilities. The meeting
will focus on the technical requirements for a job this
large. They wouldn't have to meet with us, and we're glad they did
because it will make the permit process more efficient.

**Financing is being concluded.** We have secured financing at a
10 year term and between 3 and 4% interest (market rate for secured
10-year debt). If you would like to lend money to Adobe Creek at that
interest rate, let me know and we'll borrow less from other
sources.

**Rough timeline.** Two things must happen before we can start
construction: the City needs to approve our Street Work Permit, and
our materials and equipment must arrive (backbone multiduct, backbone
fiber, vaults, switches, etc.). We're not sure which of those will be
on the critical path, or exactly how long they will take.

There's a lot more work going on behind the scenes. Please contact any
of us for more information or to volunteer to help.
