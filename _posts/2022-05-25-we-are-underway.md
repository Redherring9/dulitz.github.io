In the two months since our last update, things have moved forward quickly.  <i>[more...]</i>

**Welcome new members!** We're excited to announce that nine folks
have joined Adobe Creek as full voting members. Adobe Creek is owned
and controlled by its members, and we thank these people for their
support to keep us going in these early days. If you plan to get
service from Adobe Creek, please move towards joining now. To join,
fill out this membership form. Email me directly if you have any
questions.

**We have signed contracts** with Next Level Networks for engineering
and permitting as well as for the equipment and materials we will
install. In order to pay for those contracts we have used membership
dues and borrowed money. Some of the equipment has already arrived,
notably the long-lead-time switches.

**What's happening now?** In addition to finalizing the easements, we're
planning for the annual meeting, drafting contracts, working closely
with the City of Palo Alto to advance our dark fiber link (on track
for this fall), and working with the community fiber organizations
in Woodside and Los Altos Hills to reduce costs by sharing our dark
fiber. We're still surveying and finalizing the detailed design but
we're very close to design freeze. The website is in progress. And
we're working to get everyone on board as members.
