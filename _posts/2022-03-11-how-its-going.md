It's hard to believe it's only been 7 weeks since Adobe Creek's first
update. We've kept a low profile but a lot has been happening behind
the scenes.  <i>[more...]</i>

**Meet our new logo!** Carrie Beyer, who grew up on Page Mill just
above Moody, directed us in a very professional and productive
creative process. The logo leads with a fiber cable composed of
strands, connecting to the natural physical environment we live in
and love. I'm a fan of our logo and I hope you are too, because
we'll all be seeing a lot more of it in the months and years ahead.

**Call for early members.** The Board of Directors recently approved our
Membership Agreement, which means that we can have members. You do not
need to become a member now; you can wait until we get much closer to
activating service. But if you would like to show support for Adobe
Creek, you can become an early member, attend the 2022 Annual Meeting,
and vote for directors and other membership business. The membership
fee is $1,000, which counts as one-third of your total signup fee. If
you're interested in becoming an early member, please fill out this
membership form which asks you a few questions so we can send you the
right document to sign.

**What happens next?** After contract signing, the next major milestone
will be "permits granted." Leading up to that, there will be a survey,
and then the survey data will be used in the detailed design of the
network. When we approve the design, permit documents will be created
and our permit application submitted. And then the permit documents
will be modified in response to plan check comments and resubmitted.

**Surveys begin next month.** Our fiber network will be fully underground,
which is very good for reliability and aesthetics. When we install it,
we need to know where existing services are so we can avoid them, and
that's what the survey is for. We will coordinate with you in advance
to find a convenient time to survey your property. One of the most
important things will be to map sewer laterals -- the City knows where
the mains are but has no idea about the laterals. We have the
equipment needed to do this, so we will ask you to show us your sewer
cleanout(s) so we can feed our locator "sonde" into the lateral.
