Our service area includes every parcel between 3810 Page Mill Road,
Palo Alto, and the City of Palo Alto's Montebello Reservoir.

To receive service from Adobe Creek directly, you must:
* own one of the Lots in our service area,
* become a member of Adobe Creek, and
* sign a Service Agreement with Adobe Creek.

The membership fee is $1000, and the initial non-recurring charge
("installation fee") for any residential service is an additional
$2000. For membership materials, please [contact
us](mailto:info@adobecreek.net). If you're not a member of Adobe Creek
and can't become one, please contact our reseller, [South Branch
Fiber](https://southbranch.net/).

### Residential services

* Our mainstay is 1 Gbps down and 1 Gbps upload -â€“ over 30x faster
upload than offered by cable modems like Xfinity.

* We also offer affordable 100 Mbps down and 100 Mbps upload, still
  3x faster upload than cable modems.

* Budget 10 Mbps down-and-upload is also available.

### Small business and dedicated services

* 5 Gbps small-business service is available with higher speeds and
  fewer restrictions than residential services.

* 1 Gbps dedicated service (never shared, never throttled), burstable
  to 2 Gbps or more, is available for $1000/month with no
  restrictions. This is a lot of money, but we charge significantly
  less than any competitor in the Bay Area that we know of.

### High reliability

If the datacenter has power, and you have power, our three-way backup
power system (solar, battery, and auto-starting propane genset) will
keep you lit even through long Public Safety Power Shutoffs or downed
wires.

Our head-end switches are fully redundant, and any Gigabit service can
be delivered to each subscriber over two redundant fibers, one fiber
to each switch.

Dark fiber is our primary backhaul. In addition our multi-gigabit
radios stand by to take traffic instantaneously in case of a fiber
cut.
