Adobe Creek Networks is a non-profit founded in 2022 to bring fiber
Internet to the Upper Page Mill Road area of Palo Alto. As a mutual
benefit corporation, Adobe Creek provides service to, and is owned by,
its members in the neighborhood. Our directors and officers are all
volunteers, and we hire for-profit contractors to engineer, install,
and maintain our network.

Our service area currently includes areas in and near the Upper Page
Mill Road neighborhood of Palo Alto, California. We hope to expand
service to adjacent areas; if you're interested please contact us.
